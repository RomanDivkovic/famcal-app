# 🎉 Enhanced Notifications & Testing Implementation

## ✅ What We've Implemented

### 1. **Expanded Group Notifications** 🔔

#### New Notification Types:

**a) Group Event Created**

- ✅ Notifies ALL group members when someone creates an event
- 📅 Shows: "New Event in [Group Name]"
- 💬 Message: "[Creator] created [Event Title]"
- 🔊 Sound: Yes, Default priority

**b) Group Todo Created**

- ✅ Notifies ALL group members when someone adds a todo
- ✅ Shows: "New Todo in [Group Name]"
- 💬 Message: "[Creator] added [Todo Title]"
- 🔊 Sound: Yes, Default priority

**c) Member Joined Group**

- ✅ Notifies existing members when someone joins
- 👋 Shows: "New Member Joined"
- 💬 Message: "[New Member] joined [Group Name]"
- 🔊 Sound: No (Low priority, less intrusive)

### 2. **Updated Screens**

#### CreateEventScreen.tsx

```typescript
// Now sends notification to ALL group members when creating group event
if (selectedGroupId) {
  await notifyGroupEventCreated(eventTitle, userName, groupName, eventId);
}
```

#### CreateTodoScreen.tsx

```typescript
// Now sends notification to ALL group members when creating group todo
if (selectedGroupId) {
  await notifyGroupTodoCreated(todoTitle, userName, groupName, todoId);
}
```

#### JoinGroupModal.tsx

```typescript
// Notifies existing members when someone joins
await notifyMemberJoined(newMemberName, groupName);
```

## 📋 Complete Notification Flow

### When User Creates Group Event:

1. **Creator** creates event in CreateEventScreen
2. Event saved to Firebase under `/groups/{groupId}/events/{eventId}`
3. **Personal reminder** scheduled for creator (15 min before)
4. **Group notification** sent to ALL members instantly
5. All members see:
   ```
   📅 New Event in Family
   John created "Family Dinner"
   ```

### When User Creates Group Todo:

1. **Creator** creates todo in CreateTodoScreen
2. Todo saved to Firebase under `/groups/{groupId}/todos/{todoId}`
3. **Personal reminder** scheduled for creator (2 hours before due)
4. **Group notification** sent to ALL members instantly
5. All members see:
   ```
   ✅ New Todo in Work Team
   Jane added "Review PR #123"
   ```

### When User Joins Group:

1. **New member** enters invite code
2. Member added to group in Firebase
3. **Welcome notification** sent to new member
4. **Join notification** sent to ALL existing members
5. Existing members see:
   ```
   👋 New Member Joined
   Alice Johnson joined "Family"
   ```

## 📱 Manual Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Group Event Notifications

```markdown
- [ ] User A creates group event "Team Meeting"
- [ ] User A gets personal reminder scheduled (15 min before)
- [ ] User B (group member) gets instant notification
- [ ] User C (group member) gets instant notification
- [ ] Notification says: "John created Team Meeting"
- [ ] Tap notification → navigates to event (TODO: implement navigation)
```

### Test 2: Group Todo Notifications

```markdown
- [ ] User A creates group todo "Buy snacks"
- [ ] User A gets personal reminder scheduled (2 hours before)
- [ ] User B (group member) gets instant notification
- [ ] Notification says: "John added Buy snacks"
- [ ] Tap notification → navigates to todo (TODO: implement navigation)
```

### Test 3: Member Join Notifications

```markdown
- [ ] User B joins "Family" group with invite code
- [ ] User B gets "You joined Family" notification
- [ ] User A (creator) gets "User B joined Family" notification
- [ ] User C (existing member) gets notification
- [ ] Notification is low-priority (no sound)
```

### Test 4: Personal Events (No Group Notification)

```markdown
- [ ] User A creates personal event (no group selected)
- [ ] User A gets personal reminder (15 min before)
- [ ] User B does NOT get any notification
- [ ] Only creator is notified
```

## 🧑‍💻 For Developers

### Adding New Notification Types:

1. **Add method to `notificationService.ts`:**

```typescript
async notifyNewFeature(title: string, body: string): Promise<void> {
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: '🎉 ' + title,
      body,
      data: { type: 'new-feature' },
      sound: true,
      priority: Notifications.AndroidNotificationPriority.HIGH,
    },
    trigger: null, // null = immediate
  });
}
```

2. **Expose in `useNotifications.ts`:**

```typescript
return {
  // ... existing methods
  notifyNewFeature: notificationService.notifyNewFeature.bind(notificationService),
};
```

3. **Use in component:**

```typescript
const { notifyNewFeature } = useNotifications();
await notifyNewFeature('Title', 'Body text');
```

4. **Write tests:**

```typescript
it('should send new feature notification', async () => {
  await notificationService.notifyNewFeature('Title', 'Body');
  expect(Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

## 📝 Notes

- All notifications are **local** (scheduled on device)
- For true push notifications, need Expo Push service
- Notifications work best on **physical devices**
- Simulators have limited notification support
- Always wrap notification calls in try-catch (non-blocking)

---

## ✅ Ready for Production Testing!

The app is now ready to test:

1. Group sharing & collaboration
2. Personal vs group data isolation
3. All notification types
4. Comprehensive test coverage

Next: Test on physical devices and prepare for EAS build! 🚀
