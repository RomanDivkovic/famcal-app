# Changes Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Fixed Todo Toggle Permission Error

**Problem**:

- Todo toggle was failing with "Permission denied" errors
- When `toggleTodoComplete` was called without groupId, it couldn't find todos stored in groups
- Firebase rules for `/todos/` were causing permission issues

**Solution**:

- Modified `getTodoById()` to comprehensively search for todos:
  1. Check specific group (if groupId provided) - `/groups/{groupId}/todos/`
  2. Check personal todos - `/users/{uid}/personal-todos/`
  3. **Search ALL user's groups** (if no groupId) - iterates through all groups user belongs to
  4. Check root todos (fallback) - `/todos/` (wrapped in try/catch)
- Updated `toggleTodoComplete()` to use logic-based path selection:
  - If todo has `groupId` → update at `/groups/{groupId}/todos/`
  - Otherwise → update at `/users/{uid}/personal-todos/`
  - Fallback to `/todos/` only if no user is logged in

**Impact**: Todo toggle now works reliably by searching all possible locations where a todo might be stored

### ✅ 2. Added Dropdown for Group Selection

**Problem**:

- CreateTodoScreen and CreateEventScreen showed all groups as separate buttons
- Not scalable for users with many groups
- Poor UX for group selection

**Solution**:
Created new `Dropdown` component with bottom sheet:

- **Component**: `/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.tsx`
  - Uses `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` for smooth modal experience
  - Dynamic snap points based on number of options
  - Consistent with app design
  - Shows icons for each option
  - Displays checkmark for selected option
  - Supports keyboard navigation

- **Updated CreateTodoScreen**:
  - Replaced button list with `<Dropdown>` component
  - Options: "Personal Todo" + all groups
  - Automatically converts "personal" value to `undefined` for groupId

- **Updated CreateEventScreen**:
  - Replaced button list with `<Dropdown>` component
  - Options: "Personal Event" + all groups
  - Automatically converts "personal" value to `undefined` for groupId

**Impact**:

- Better UX for group selection
- Scales to any number of groups
- Consistent UI pattern across todo and event creation
- Cleaner code

---

### ✅ 3. Verified Event Deletion

**Verified**:

- `deleteEvent()` method exists in `firebaseService.ts` at line 593
- EventDetailScreen properly implements delete functionality with:
  - Confirmation alert before deletion
  - Permission check (`canEdit` = user is creator)
  - Proper error handling
  - Navigation back after deletion
- Delete button only visible to event creator

**Status**: Event deletion is properly implemented and should work correctly

---

### ✅ 4. Firebase Service Refactoring Plan

**Current State**: `firebaseService.ts` is 1191 lines long - too large for maintainability

**Created Document**: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_REFACTORING_PLAN.md`

**Proposed Structure**:

```
src/services/firebase/
├── index.ts                  # Main export (FirebaseService class)
├── authService.ts           # Authentication operations (~200 lines)
├── groupsService.ts         # Group CRUD operations (~200 lines)
├── eventsService.ts         # Event CRUD operations (~150 lines)
├── todosService.ts          # Todo CRUD operations (~250 lines)
├── invitationsService.ts    # Invitation operations (~150 lines)
└── serializers.ts           # Serialization helpers (~150 lines)
```

**Benefits**:

- Each module focused on single domain
- 150-250 lines per file instead of 1191
- Easier testing, maintenance, and collaboration
- Better code organization

**Status**: Plan documented, ready to be implemented in a future task

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Todo Toggle**:
   - Create personal todo → toggle complete/incomplete
   - Create group todo → toggle complete/incomplete
   - Verify no permission errors in logs

2. **Dropdown UX**:
   - Create todo with 0 groups (only "Personal" option)
   - Create todo with 1 group (Personal + 1 group)
   - Create todo with 5+ groups (verify scrolling works)
   - Same tests for event creation

3. **Event Deletion**:
   - Create event as user A
   - Verify user A can delete event
   - Login as user B (group member)
   - Verify user B cannot see delete button

---

## Next Steps (Future Tasks)

1. **Deploy Firebase Rules**: Ensure latest rules are deployed to production
2. **Implement Service Refactoring**: Follow FIREBASE_SERVICE_REFACTORING_PLAN.md
3. **Add Tests**: Write unit tests for new Dropdown component
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any remaining permission errors in production

---

## Known Issues (Pre-existing)

- `firebaseService.ts` has many TypeScript lint warnings about using `any` type
- These warnings existed before this work and should be addressed during refactoring
