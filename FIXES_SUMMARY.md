# ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed (October 21, 2025)

### 1. **Members Not Showing in Group Detail** âœ…

**Problem:** Group detail screen showed "Members (0)" even though user was in the group.

**Root Cause:** The `Group.members` type was changed from `string[]` (array) to `{ [userId: string]: boolean }` (object/map) for better Firebase querying, but GroupDetailScreen was still treating it as an array.

**Fix Applied:**

- Updated `GroupDetailScreen.tsx` to work with object-based members
- Changed `groupData.members.length` to `Object.keys(groupData.members).length`
- Changed `groupData.members.map()` to `Object.keys(groupData.members).map()`

**File:** `src/screens/Group/GroupDetailScreen.tsx`

**Before:**

```typescript
if (groupData?.members && groupData.members.length > 0) {
  const membersList = await Promise.all(
    groupData.members.map(async (memberId) => { ... })
  );
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
if (groupData?.members && typeof groupData.members === 'object') {
  const memberIds = Object.keys(groupData.members);
  if (memberIds.length > 0) {
    const membersList = await Promise.all(
      memberIds.map(async (memberId) => { ... })
    );
  }
}
```

### 2. **"Failed to find group by invite code" Error** âœ…

**Problem:** When a new user tried to join a group using an invite code, they got "DataServiceError: Failed to find group by invite code".

**Root Cause:** The `JoinGroupModal` was checking if user is already a member with `group.members.includes(user.id)`, which doesn't work with object-based members.

**Fix Applied:**

- Updated `JoinGroupModal.tsx` to check membership using object property
- Changed `group.members.includes(user.id)` to `group.members[user.id]`

**File:** `src/components/JoinGroupModal.tsx`

**Before:**

```typescript
if (group.members.includes(user.id)) {
  Alert.alert('Already a Member', `You are already a member of ${group.name}`);
  return;
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
if (group.members && group.members[user.id]) {
  Alert.alert('Already a Member', `You are already a member of ${group.name}`);
  return;
}
```

### 3. **Added Notifications to Event Creation** âœ…

**Feature:** Users now get notified 15 minutes before an event starts.

**Implementation:**

- Imported `useNotifications` hook in `CreateEventScreen.tsx`
- After event is created, schedule notification
- Notification is scheduled 15 minutes before event start time
- If notification scheduling fails, event creation still succeeds

**File:** `src/screens/Event/CreateEventScreen.tsx`

**Code Added:**

```typescript
import { useGroups, useNotifications } from '../../hooks';

// In component:
const { scheduleEventNotification } = useNotifications();

// After creating event:
try {
  await scheduleEventNotification(
    createdEvent.id,
    createdEvent.title,
    startDateTime,
    15 // 15 minutes before
  );
  console.info('Event notification scheduled');
} catch (notifError) {
  console.error('Failed to schedule notification:', notifError);
  // Don't fail event creation if notification fails
}
```

---

### 4. **Added Notifications to Todo Creation** âœ…

**Feature:** Users now get notified 2 hours before a todo is due.

**Implementation:**

- Imported `useNotifications` hook in `CreateTodoScreen.tsx`
- After todo is created, schedule notification (if todo has due date)
- Notification is scheduled 2 hours before due date
- If notification scheduling fails, todo creation still succeeds

**File:** `src/screens/Todos/CreateTodoScreen.tsx`

**Code Added:**

```typescript
import { useGroups, useNotifications } from '../../hooks';

// In component:
const { scheduleTodoNotification } = useNotifications();

// After creating todo:
if (dueDate) {
  try {
    await scheduleTodoNotification(
      createdTodo.id,
      title.trim(),
      new Date(dueDate),
      2 // 2 hours before
    );
    console.info('Todo notification scheduled');
  } catch (notifError) {
    console.error('Failed to schedule notification:', notifError);
    // Don't fail todo creation if notification fails
  }
}
```

---

### 5. **Added Notifications When Joining Group** âœ…

**Feature:** Users get an instant notification when they successfully join a group.

**Implementation:**

- Imported `useNotifications` hook in `JoinGroupModal.tsx`
- After successfully joining group, send instant notification
- If notification sending fails, group join still succeeds

**File:** `src/components/JoinGroupModal.tsx`

**Code Added:**

```typescript
import { useNotifications } from '../hooks';

// In component:
const { sendGroupInviteNotification } = useNotifications();

// After joining group:
try {
  await sendGroupInviteNotification(
    group.name,
    'You' // Since it's the user joining
  );
  console.info('Group join notification sent');
} catch (notifError) {
  console.error('Failed to send notification:', notifError);
  // Don't fail join if notification fails
}
```

---

### 6. **Exported useNotifications Hook** âœ…

**Implementation:**

- Added export to `src/hooks/index.ts`

**Code Added:**

```typescript
export { useNotifications } from './useNotifications';
```

## Known Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. TypeScript linting warnings for `any` type in:
   - `CreateEventScreen.tsx` line 65
   - `CreateTodoScreen.tsx` line 54
   - These are non-critical and don't affect functionality
